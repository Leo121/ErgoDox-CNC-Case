CNC Machined Case for ErgoDox
=============================

Please note that I'm not a professional CAD operator and I only wanted to create a better case for an ErgoDox keyboard.
I run a mini machine shop as a hobby after work and created those designs to cut the case myself.
The first attempt was a 2 piece design cut out of hard PVC sheet (8mm).
It is very decent but not the level I like it to be so I started designing a unibody case cut from one piece of material.
For the prototypes I'm going to use pine wood, if it turns out well, it's going to be cut out of aluminium.
Feel free to download those designs and modify up to your needs before you cut them yourself (or let someone else cut them for you).
The .cb files are generated by CamBam, a program which I use for creating designs and toolpaths for CNC mill.
